# Topic-Modeling-of-news-Articles

1. Project  Overview  :  Conducted  an  analysis  utilizing  topic  modeling techniques  on  a  dataset  comprising  approximately  12,000  news  articles, aiming  to  unveil  latent  topics  within  the  corpus  through  unsupervised learning methods. 
2. Data  Collection:  Utilized  the  newsdata.io  API  to  scrape  titles  and  content from  diverse  news  articles,  subsequently  storing  the  data  in  a  structured format within a CSV file. 
3. Text  Preprocessing:  Employed  a  combination  of  NLTK,  pandas,  numpy and  regular  expressions  to  preprocess  the  textual  data,  ensuring uniformity and cleanliness for subsequent analysis. 
4. Unsupervised  Learning  Model:  Implemented  the  Latent  Dirichlet Allocation  (LDA)  algorithm  to  model  the  preprocessed  news  article  data, extracting latent topics inherent within the corpus. 
5. Visualization:  Employed  PyLDA  to  visualize  and  interpret  the  topics extracted from the corpus of news articles. 
6. Evaluation  Metrics:  Achieved  a  perplexity  score  of  -14.339  and  a coherence score of 0.556.
