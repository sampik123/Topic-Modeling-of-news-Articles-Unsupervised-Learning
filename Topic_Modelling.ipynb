And on Sunday, the model took the next step in their relationship by going Instagram official. Sharing a gallery of loved-up photos with her 183K followers, Erin was ready to show off her beau. 'Our recent adventures QT/Magnetic Island' she captioned the post. In one photo, the couple are seen smiling while standing in the snow after going on ski trip to Queenstown New Zealand . Model Erin McNaught, 41, (left) went Instagram official with her new music producer boyfriend Stasi 'Stace Cadet' Kotaras (right) on Sunday - following her shock split from rapper Example Sharing a gallery of loved-up photos with her 183K followers, Erin was ready to show off her beau Another photo shows Erin squished between two rocks, wearing a crop top and a denim skirt while on holiday in Magnetic Island. The pair haven't made any formal announcement of their relationship, but last month shared a number of flirty exchanges on Instagram. 'Last little chunk of life. It's been good to me,' McNaught captioned a slew of photos, with a love heart emoji. 'Our recent adventures QT/Magnetic Island' she captioned the post 'Yes it has,' Stace Cadet replied, with a wink and two heart emojis. The mother-of-two left a fire and heart emoji on his post about doing a 'little mix' for the 'legends at Triple J'. Erin and her ex-husband, rapper Example, real name Elliot Gleave, announced their split in October last year. Another photo shows Erin squished between two rocks, wearing a crop top and a denim skirt while on holiday in Magnetic Island The A-list couple were married from 2013 to 2022. The performer is now seeing art advisor Daisy Cox, who has relocated to Australia to be with him. Example wrote that their romance came to a 'natural end' after 11 years together and said that he and Erin will still be happily co-parenting their sons Evander, aged seven, and Ennio, aged five. In a joint Instagram statement, the couple explained: 'At the start of the UK summer we decided to separate. We have had an amazing 11 years together, but just a few too many adventures. Erin and her ex-husband, rapper Example, real name Elliot Gleave, (left) announced their split in October last year. The pair were married from 2013 to 2022 'Obviously we spent a lot of time behind the scenes trying to figure things out, but we came to the realisation that perhaps our time as a couple had just come to a natural end. 'So we have decided to go our separate ways whilst there is still an abundance of love and respect for one another. 'We have been co-parenting happily and effectively now for almost half a year and our boys are surrounded with love.' Continuing his statement, he penned: 'Due to Elliot's busy summer schedule over 14 weeks in Europe, Erin and the boys flew to London for 4 weeks so Elliot wouldn't have to go months without seeing Evander and Ennio. 'We had an amazing family holiday, and look forward to more in the future. We have had incredible support from our closest friends and family, who are proud of how are handling this separation. 'We have turned off commenting to protect ourselves, our children and closest friends and family. Please do not feel the need to text or DM us whoever you are.' Example and Erin are continuing to co-parent their sons Evander, aged seven, and Ennio, aged five.

But when there\\'s something wrong with your heart, it can sometimes be hard to tell, as a lot of heart conditions don\\'t present any noticeable symptoms. This means that some problems can take years to diagnose, but according to experts, you should always get checked if you\\'re concerned about your heart health in any way - and this is why knowing the early signs is vital. Read More Related Articles Health experts share what foods are bad for your skin and how they cause acne Read More Related Articles Signs of hearing loss as experts share jobs most likely to cause permanent damage â\\x80\\x9cHidden heart conditions often go undiagnosed for too long, until something goes wrong or itâ\\x80\\x99s too late,â\\x80\\x9d said Sindy Jodar, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation (BHF). \"Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why it is important to never ignore the signs of heart disease and get yourself checked , just to be sure .â\\x80\\x9d While some warning signs are easy to spot â\\x80\\x93 such as severe chest pain and collapse â\\x80\\x93 there are also many little indicators that something could be wrong with your heart or circulatory system. These wonâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily mean you have a heart problem, but itâ\\x80\\x99s always best to have them investigated. From tiredness and nausea to fainting, here are some of the less obvious symptoms everyone needs to know about. Feeling unusually tired Dr M Adil U Khan, a GP at Pall Mall Medical, says you should not â\\x80\\x9cignore or downplay unusual levels of tirednessâ\\x80\\x9d. While itâ\\x80\\x99s normal to feel exhausted if youâ\\x80\\x99ve been very busy or lacking sleep, he adds: â\\x80\\x9cFeeling unusually tired, especially if itâ\\x80\\x99s not related to exertion, should be investigated.â\\x80\\x9d It could be due to something like anaemia, a virus, or even linked to mental health. It could also be related to your heart, so it is important to have it investigated. Subtle discomfort â\\x80\\x9cLook out for subtle discomfort in different areas of your body, including discomfort or pain in the jaw, neck, back, or stomach, which can be associated with a heart problem,â\\x80\\x9d says Khan. If symptoms are out of the norm for you and arenâ\\x80\\x99t going away, itâ\\x80\\x99s always best to get them checked. Unusual swelling If you\\'ve noticed any unusual swelling, it may be worth getting it checked out by a doctor (Image: Getty Images) Perhaps you have noticed your ankles look particularly puffy, or maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s your general tummy area thatâ\\x80\\x99s constantly swollen for no apparent reason. â\\x80\\x9cUnexplained swelling, known as oedema, in the legs, ankles or abdomen, may also be signs of heart failure,â\\x80\\x9d explains Khan. Vomiting and a choking sensation Sudden vomiting or a choking sensation in your throat is something to be wary of too. â\\x80\\x9cWhile not every bout of nausea means there could be something serious happening, feeling sick combined with other aches and pains, such as severe chest pain, should ring an alarm bell,â\\x80\\x9d says Jodar. It could be a stomach bug, but if you are having sudden spells of vomiting and nausea more regularly and youâ\\x80\\x99re not sure why, donâ\\x80\\x99t delay in get things checked out.

Depending on your symptoms and risk factors, you may undergo diagnostic tests like ECGs, echocardiograms, stress tests, blood tests, or more specialised cardiac assessments,â\\x80\\x9d he adds. Shortness of breath Struggling to catch your breath isn\\'t a trivial matter. â\\x80\\x9cAnyone experiencing shortness of breath during everyday activities or at rest should see their doctor,â\\x80\\x9d says Khan. This is especially the case if itâ\\x80\\x99s accompanied by chest pain â\\x80\\x93 even if it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem especially severe. Khan adds: â\\x80\\x9cMild chest discomfort should always be investigated, but some people mistake this for indigestion or muscular pain.â\\x80\\x9d Top Health Stories Today Eating one fruit found to improve eyes The winter vitamin the NHS recommends The most recent Covid symptoms Alzheimer\\'s linked to health problem Unusual sweating â\\x80\\x9cFeeling hot, clammy and quite sweaty when you havenâ\\x80\\x99t been doing strenuous exercise shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be ignored,â\\x80\\x9d adds Jodar. â\\x80\\x9cIf this is combined with chest pains, itâ\\x80\\x99s important you get yourself looked at.â\\x80\\x9d Heart rate irregularities If your pulse sometimes feels jumpy or too fast, it may be worth getting it checked with your doctor. Khan says: â\\x80\\x9cSmartwatches and fitness trackers can provide valuable data about your heart rate and may detect irregularities to some extent. They can help track general trends in heart rate, especially during physical activity or rest. â\\x80\\x9cHowever, they are not a substitute for medical-grade monitoring and evaluationâ\\x80¦ Any concerning symptoms should be evaluated by a healthcare professional for a comprehensive assessment and diagnosis,â\\x80\\x9d Khan adds.

It could be a stomach bug, but if you are having sudden spells of vomiting and nausea more regularly and youâ\\x80\\x99re not sure why, donâ\\x80\\x99t delay in get things checked out.
